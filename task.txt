Phase 1: 
Create a class that would represent pc parts. 
	It should contain basic methods to retreive items name, price, colour 
	(if applicable).
PC part list can be found here: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/
The every separate part should have at least 3-4 methods to gather this part 
	specific data 
	(example: CPU - brand , speed, power usuage etc.)
At this stage, dictionary data structures can work as Database.
	OOP abstraction, inheritance 
	and encapsulation must be presented in a code base. 
Unit tests must be written for the methods.

Phase 2: 
Add logging to all necessary functionality to see the data flow 
	(with logger config.).
Add exception handling , describe your own exceptions if necessary. 
Create functions that would update current datasets (database). 
Add functions that would parse durrent datasets(database) by 
	specific parameters (CPU name = 'AMD') 
Use  List, Dict comprehentions to get parsed data.
